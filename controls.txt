Player 4:

Weapons:
weapon button + up: bomb

weapon button + right: homing rocket
weapon button + down: block

egg button + left: egg stealing thing
egg button + up: pacman type block muncher
egg button + right: drone thing that just makes a nuisance of itself
egg button + down: robot that fires homing rockets (nice)
egg button + no direction: energy thing that gives you back more energy than it costs



I plan to make it so you can set up your own control scheme and also have joypad/joystick input so everyone doesn't have to crowd round the computer.
